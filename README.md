# MetGalleryProject

This project represents an Android mobile application for the Metropolitian Museum of Arts. It allows users to serach through the museum's gallery of artworks and save their favourite pieces.

The application is written in Kotlin and follows the MVVM architecture. It uses Retrofit for integrating the Met Museum API with Moshi handling serialization and deserialization. For optimal display of results, the app uses Paging Compose and LazyColumn. The UI is built with Jetpack Compose and images are loaded using COIL.
